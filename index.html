<p>
  Custom Firefox Feature Development (Fall 2015) <br>
  -Implemented custom features in Mozilla Firefox with a team of six members <br>
  -Composed UML Class and Use Case diagrams to as part of the feature description <br>
  -Employed software development tools such as version control using Subversion (SVN), and Integrated Development Environment (IDE) software using Eclipse. <br>
  -Gained a deeper understanding of Agile software development methodologies by actively participating in weekly Scrum meetings. <br>
  
  Music Industry Database Fall 2015
-Constructed a relational database using PostgreSQL based on a schema defining songs, authors, and albums
-Wrote SQL statements to perform queries and changes to the database
-Utilized JDBC to provide access to the database in Java programs
Program Parallelization and Optimization Fall 2015
-Applied optimization methods on Conway’s “Game of Life”
-Achieved a speedup of 30x by utilizing the POSIX Threads Library and thread synchronization techniques such as barriers, locks, and semaphores, as well as revising the game algorithm to reduce run-time complexity
Python Web Search Engine Fall 2015
-Developed a web search engine using Python and MongoDB
-Deployed the search engine application to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and integrated third party APIs such as Google Login and PyMongo
-Developed additional features for the search engine such as AWS deployment/termination script; auto-completion, and search suggestion on the frontend; as well as search data structure optimization on the backend
Dynamic Memory Allocator Fall 2015
-Developed support functions for a dynamic memory allocator
-Kept track of free memory blocks using an explicit list implementation to improve search speed and reduce overhead.
-Programmed a heap consistency checker which keeps track of the address and validity of all free blocks, as well as ensuring no overlap occurs between freed blocks.
-Thoroughly improved understanding on the trade-offs of various dynamic memory allocator designs and memory management policies for C/C++.
User-level Threading Library Fall 2014
-Designed a user-level threading library in C language to enable concurrent programming
-Generated threads by allocating custom stack for its signal handler and populated its context with system calls
-Simulated software interrupts with timing signals to implement preemptive scheduling
-Implemented locking/synchronization techniques on x86 architecture using POSIX API
Digital System Design Project Spring 2016
-Designed a simulated duck hunt game using Verilog on a Xilinx Nexys-7 DDR FPGA board
-The system contains GPIO and PMOD I/O interfaces to external modules such as a digital camera and audio speakers
-Contains motion capturing and filtering modules to detect user’s movements and allow the user to play the game with their hands or high-contrast coloured household items
-Improved knowledge and understanding of industry hardware development tools and methodologies by participating in weekly team meetings to keep track of development progress and project plan revisions
Multi-threaded Client/Server Application with Cache Spring 2014
-Designed a client-server application with optimal response time/security in C language on top of the POSIX Socket/Pthreads API
-Incorporated parsing tools (Flex & Bison) to maintain a faster and cleaner parsing logic
-Integrated caching strategies into the software architecture for faster response time
-Achieved faster response time by increasing throughput via multi-threading
