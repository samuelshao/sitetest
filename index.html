<p>
   <b>Custom Firefox Feature Development (Fall 2015) </b> <br>
  -Implemented custom features in Mozilla Firefox with a team of six members <br>
  -Composed UML Class and Use Case diagrams to as part of the feature description <br>
  -Employed software development tools such as version control using Subversion (SVN), and Integrated Development Environment (IDE) software using Eclipse. <br>
  -Gained a deeper understanding of Agile software development methodologies by actively participating in weekly Scrum meetings.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Music Industry Database (Fall 2015) </b> <br>
   -Constructed a relational database using PostgreSQL based on a schema defining songs, authors, and albums <br>
   -Wrote SQL statements to perform queries and changes to the database <br>
   -Utilized JDBC to provide access to the database in Java programs
</p>
<p>
   <b>Program Parallelization and Optimization (Fall 2015) </b> <br>
   -Applied optimization methods on Conway’s “Game of Life” <br>
   -Achieved a speedup of 30x by utilizing the POSIX Threads Library and thread synchronization techniques such as barriers, locks, and semaphores, as well as revising the game algorithm to reduce run-time complexity
</p>
<p>
   <b>Python Web Search Engine (Fall 2015) </b> <br>
   -Developed a web search engine using Python and MongoDB <br>
   -Deployed the search engine application to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and integrated third party APIs such as Google Login and PyMongo <br>
   -Developed additional features for the search engine such as AWS deployment/termination script; auto-completion, and search suggestion on the frontend; as well as search data structure optimization on the backend
</p>
<p>
   <b>Dynamic Memory Allocator (Fall 2015) </b> <br>
   -Developed support functions for a dynamic memory allocator <br>
   -Kept track of free memory blocks using an explicit list implementation to improve search speed and reduce overhead. <br>
   -Programmed a heap consistency checker which keeps track of the address and validity of all free blocks, as well as ensuring no overlap occurs between freed blocks. <br>
   -Thoroughly improved understanding on the trade-offs of various dynamic memory allocator designs and memory management policies for C/C++.
</p>
<p>
   <b>User-level Threading Library (Fall 2014) </b> <br>
   -Designed a user-level threading library in C language to enable concurrent programming <br>
   -Generated threads by allocating custom stack for its signal handler and populated its context with system calls <br>
   -Simulated software interrupts with timing signals to implement preemptive scheduling <br>
   -Implemented locking/synchronization techniques on x86 architecture using POSIX API
</p>
<p>
   <b>Digital System Design Project (Spring 2016) </b> <br>
   -Designed a simulated duck hunt game using Verilog on a Xilinx Nexys-7 DDR FPGA board <br>
   -The system contains GPIO and PMOD I/O interfaces to external modules such as a digital camera and audio speakers <br>
   -Contains motion capturing and filtering modules to detect user’s movements and allow the user to play the game with their hands or high-contrast coloured household items <br>
   -Improved knowledge and understanding of industry hardware development tools and methodologies by participating in weekly team meetings to keep track of development progress and project plan revisions
</p>
<p>
   <b>Multi-threaded Client/Server Application with Cache (Spring 2014) </b> <br>
   -Designed a client-server application with optimal response time/security in C language on top of the POSIX Socket/Pthreads API <br>
   -Incorporated parsing tools (Flex & Bison) to maintain a faster and cleaner parsing logic <br>
   -Integrated caching strategies into the software architecture for faster response time <br>
   -Achieved faster response time by increasing throughput via multi-threading
</p>
